# A simple MongoDB Kotlin tryout

This weekend I attended a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Istanbul-Java-User-Group/events/235403462/ "Istanbul JavaUserGroup's MongoDB Workshop") on MongoDB in Istanbul.
Since I am passionate about Kotlin, I quickly created a test project with Kotlin and Mongo.

I liked Mongo, the eagerness of it to quickly start putting data and such.
